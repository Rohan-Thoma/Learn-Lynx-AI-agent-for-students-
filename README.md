## 🚨 Problem Statement

Students often face immense pressure to prepare effectively in a short time. Traditional study methods lack personalization and interactivity, making it hard to stay engaged. Moreover, human teachers aren’t available 24/7 to answer doubts or guide last-minute revisions. This leads to stress, inefficiency, and wasted time — leaving little room for extracurriculars or relaxation.

Students need a smarter way to prepare fast, stay motivated, and reduce exam anxiety — all while balancing their overall well-being.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Learn-Lynx** is a GenAI-powered study assistant designed to make exam prep fast, fun, and stress-free. It provides personalized learning plans, instant doubt resolution, and interactive quizzes tailored to the student’s syllabus. Available 24/7, Learn-Lynx ensures no question goes unanswered, while gamified features keep students engaged and motivated — even with just two days left for the exam.

By combining the power of Google's Gemini AI agentic framework, Learn-Lynx helps students focus on what matters most, saving time for hobbies and self-care.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Base Creation with ChromaDB

* **Textbook Ingestion**: Students can upload their textbooks or study materials in PDF format directly into the system. These documents are then processed and converted into vector embeddings using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
* **Vector Database Storage**: The processed embeddings are stored in ChromaDB, creating a structured and searchable knowledge base tailored to the student’s syllabus. This ensures that all interactions with Learn-Lynx are contextually relevant and personalized.

### 2. Question Generation and Interactive Quizzes

* **Q\&A Generation**: Using the ingested textbook data, Learn-Lynx generates contextual questions and answers to test the student’s understanding. These questions are crafted using the function-calling feature of the Gemini Agentic Framework, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
* **Interactive Quiz Mode**: Instead of static Q\&A, Learn-Lynx offers an interactive quiz session where students answer questions live. The AI agent evaluates the responses in real-time, providing instant feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect. This gamified approach keeps students engaged and motivated.

### 3. Summarization, Explanations, and Doubt Clearing

* **Summarization**: Complex topics from the uploaded textbooks are distilled into concise summaries, helping students grasp key concepts quickly.
* **Topic Explanations**: If a student struggles with a topic, they can ask for detailed explanations. Learn-Lynx uses its function-calling capabilities to provide clear, step-by-step breakdowns of even the most challenging subjects.
* **Doubt Resolution**: Students can ask follow-up questions during any interaction. Whether it’s clarifying a concept or diving deeper into a topic, Learn-Lynx ensures no doubt goes unresolved.

### 4. Structured Query Grounding for Precision

* **JSON Outputs**: All generated content — be it quizzes, summaries, or explanations — is formatted into precise JSON outputs. This guarantees clean, consistent, and machine-readable results.
* **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**: Learn-Lynx creates well-structured MCQs with clear options and answers, making it ideal for quick revisions and self-assessments.

### 5. Real-Time Web Search for Enhanced Knowledge Safety

* **Search Grounding**: When a question falls outside the scope of the ingested textbooks, Learn-Lynx leverages the search grounding feature of the Google GenAI Agentic Framework. It queries the web in real-time to fetch up-to-date and reliable information, ensuring the student receives accurate answers without errors.
* **Knowledge Safety**: By combining internal knowledge (textbooks) with external search capabilities, Learn-Lynx eliminates the risk of misinformation, prioritizing the student’s learning integrity.

### 6. Conversational Flexibility

* **Interactive Dialogue**: Students can engage in natural, back-and-forth conversations with the AI. They can ask follow-up questions, request further explanations, or exit the chat whenever they want.
* **Customizable Learning Paths**: Based on the student’s performance in quizzes and their specific doubts, Learn-Lynx adapts to create a personalized learning path, ensuring maximum efficiency.
